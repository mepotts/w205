There are a few outliers in the average score.  The variance is relatively high
for some of the hospitals as well. I believe another measure or algorithm
may be needed to determine the best hospitals in terms of quality of care.
The high average score of some of the top hospitals is due to a lack of
many scores. The documentation about scores is not very descriptive as well.
So more information about the scores and comparing them across measures is
needed to truly compare.
